      <h2>What is GIT?</h2>
      <p>GIT is one of many control systems. It is designed primarily to manage source code ie. the lines of text that we have been experimenting with. It is essentially used during software development. Programmers use GIT to “coordinate their work” as it can track any changes that are made to the file sets. A complete history of the work performed is available for the users to review. It is also designed with speed and the integrity of data in mind. </p>
      <h2>Why do we need source code Version Control System?</h2>
      <p>A Version Control System is necessary because without it errors would occur regularly. They work by creating a list of file changes over time. When an individual modifies a file, a new file is created and stored in the repository. This prevents users from modifying an old version of the file or overriding someone else’s work. A lot of communication would be necessary without the Version Control System. </h2>
      <p>b. Describe following terms: 
1) local repo: The local repository is often referred to as a directory on your computer. It, “cashes remote downloads and contains temporary build artifacts that you have not yet released” (Maven, 2019). All of your relevant data and dependency files are stored in the local repository.
2) remote repo: Remote repositories are commonly referred to as “any other kind of repository” meaning if they do not fall under the category of a local repository, it is safe to assume they are remote. Remote repositories include file:// and http:// as explained by Maven. 
3) how to use GIT in Team Project – multiple developers work on the same project at the same time: 
You begin by creating a new project in GIT. Once this project is created, you simply invite a friend to add a new team member to your project. Multiple people can work together on the project at the same time. The files keep updating to ensure there are no duplicates. </p>
